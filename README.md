## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
- Research Assistant in Industrial Engineering at Uludag University, Turkey since Feb 2024
- My main interest areas are generative AI, web scraping and machine learning
- I use this repository to save my codes so that I can see my codes in one place and they may help people (It doesn't have a meaning otherwise in my opinion)
- The repository name is a reference to a nickname I've used when I was a kid
